      'TDesigned, simulated, and tested a high-sensitivity capacitive MEMS accelerometer for AR/VR head-mounted displays. The device featured an asymmetrical comb-drive with a variable-gap design, achieving 0.13 pF/g sensitivity over a ±20 g range. Fabricated using a Silicon-on-Glass process and integrated with a custom CMOS readout circuit, the system delivered 47 mV/g sensitivity and ~130 µg resolution. Structural and capacitance simulations were conducted in COMSOL and SolidWorks; circuit validation was performed in Cadence. The system supports electrostatic force testing and offers a tunable bandwidth up to 30 Hz—ideal for low-latency motion tracking in wearable electronics.',

      'This project focused on automating the manual and ergonomically challenging process of wire harness installation in vehicle assembly using Design for Automated Robotic Assembly (DFARA) principles. A quantitative methodology was developed to assess robotic feasibility based on geometric and functional complexity. Key contributions include a 7-digit complexity framework to evaluate handling and insertion difficulty, a cost model linking design metrics to robotic operation expenses, and an ontology-based task structure to rank installation steps by robotic difficulty. Design recommendations—such as modular harnesses, selective stiffness zones, and automation-friendly connectors—were proposed to improve robotic compatibility. The approach also incorporated product family design strategies for scalable automation across vehicle platforms, laying a foundation for AI-driven, vision-assisted robotic systems. ',
