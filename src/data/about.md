# Intro

I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, specializing in advanced manufacturing, semiconductor packaging, and design optimization. With over three years of experience at Royal Enfield, I led high-impact cost reduction initiatives across powertrain systems, driving significant savings through VAVE and design-focused solutions.

Currently, I work as a Research Associate at the Electric Vehicle Center, contributing to the development of next-generation power modules for EV traction inverters. My work involves 3D package design, COMSOL Multiphysics simulation, and system-level thermal and mechanical optimization in collaboration with six industrial partners.

My technical interests lie at the intersection of manufacturing systems, power electronics, and smart product development. I bring a strong foundation in CAD, FEA, thermal analysis, and digital manufacturing, complemented by hands-on experience in rapid prototyping and IoT product development.
